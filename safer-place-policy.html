            <h2>Safer Place Policy</h2>
            <div id="content-box">
                <p>Fresno Swing Dance (FSD) is dedicated to providing a safer dance experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, body size, age, or race. We do not tolerate safer space violations in any form.  Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event - without a refund if applicable - at the discretion of FSD organizers.
                    Safer space violations include offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, physical appearance, body size, culture, or race; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; non-consensual photography or recording; sustained disruption of events; unwanted physical contact; and unwanted sexual attention or contact. Participants asked to stop any behavior are expected to comply immediately. We expect participants to follow these rules at all FSD venues and scene events.
                    If a participant engages in behavior which violates this policy, FSD organizers may take any action they deem appropriate based on actions outlined in this policy, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event (with no refund if applicable). If you feel unsafe, notice a violation of this policy, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of FSD Executive Committee immediately.
                    A FSD venue host or Organizer will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise help participants feel safe for the duration of the event (see harassment protocol). To identify a venue host or organizer, please ask a DJ hired for that event (or someone who is working at the “Door” at larger events). The officer who makes the announcements for that week is one of the venue hosts for the evening. We value your attendance and your presence in the community.
