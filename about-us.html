                    Our group meets weekly for dance lessons and social dancing on Tuesday nights (7:00-9:30PM)
                    at Cal Arts Academy (on Blackstone Ave., between Shaw and Gettysburg Avenues). We have
                    three simultaneous dance classes, ranging from beginners to intermediate, followed by an open
                    dance. We also dance anywhere and everywhere there might be some excuse to swing dance!

                    An article from Mallory Moad, lead singer from the local band, Scats on the Sly
                    <br><br>
                    They say, “It don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing,” and Chris Pluhar would agree. He’s on
                    of the founders of Fresno Swing Dance, a casual, but close-knit, group of people who are
                    committed to creating a community centered around swing dancing. Chris says, “Our goal is to
                    get Fresno County dancing!” There are no membership dues and no auditions. All that is
                    required is to “just show up and have fun” while sharing a love for Lindy Hop, Charleston, Fedora
                    hats, jump blues, big band, and artists like Cab Calloway. In other words, all things related to swing.
                    <br><br>
                    There was a time when access to swing dancing in Fresno was only available through limited
                    instruction offered at a handful of dance studios or Fresno and Clovis Adult Schools. This was
                    the situation Chris Pluhar and Kellie Townsend found themselves in ten plus years ago when
                    they arrived from Santa Cruz, having left a vibrant swing dance scene behind. They eventually
                    came to the realization that if they wanted to keep dancing, they’d first have to become dance
                    teachers in order to have others to dance with. Their first class series took place at CSUF, with a
                    total of three students. Over the years, the locations have changed a few times and the number
                    of participants has increased to fifty or more, thanks to DIY publicity. “Facebook has been a really
                    effective way to build our community and keep people informed of dance-related events.”
                    <br><br>
                    When Kellie left the group to pursue other dance-related interests, Chris continued with the help
                    of people whom they had taught to dance. Although he may be the facilitator of Fresno Swing
                    Dance, “The glue that holds the core group together is that we’re all addicted to swing dancing!”
                    That’s a pretty happy dependency if you ask me.
                    <br><br>
                    So once a week, Fresno Swing Dance holds Toe-Tapping Tuesday from 7:00 to 9:30 at Cal Arts
                    Academy. Previously known as Wednesday Night Swing and Java Jump depending on the
                    venue, this regularly scheduled event is part lesson, part social dance, part crazy party. In
                    addition to providing footloose fanatics the opportunity to strut their stuff, it’s a good way for
                    beginners to learn, and those who are experienced to brush up on their techniques. There are
                    celebrations of milestones such as birthdays, graduations, and the longest distance traveled to
                    attend that evening’s festivities, and once a month, music is provided by a live band. It’s 
                    affordable, too. If you’ve been inspired by something you saw on Dancing With The Stars, you 
                    can give it a whirl without breaking the bank—or having to deal with grumpy judges or tacky 
                    costumes. You can get a one-hour lesson, regardless of your level or ability, and an hour of open 
                    dance for $10. The cost for the open dance only is $7, but the friends you’ll make and the good 
                    feeling you’ll be left with: priceless!
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, there are twelve people who are regularly involved in Fresno Swing Dance. They 
                    teach, organize, and keep things running smoothly in general. Although none of then are 
                    professional dance instructors, they all share a deep love for swing dance and have a wide 
                    range of dance-related experiences. Chris got his first taste of swing from the Pasadena 
                    Ballroom Dance Association in the late 1980s. He then moved on to the Swinging Slugs dance 
                    club at UC Santa Cruz. Krista Baer describes Fresno Swing Dance as a true community that 
                    made her feel welcome as a newcomer when she joined in October 2016. “There was none of 
                    the clique-ish behavior” she had encountered elsewhere. Veronica Stumpf discovered Fresno 
                    Swing Dance six years ago while writing a blog about Fresno. She sums up her feelings this 
                    way: “Some people have church. I have swing dancing.”
                    <br><br>
                    You may have seen ambassadors from Fresno Swing Dance going places and doing things 
                    around town. They can be found almost anywhere there’s danceable music, including Gazebo 
                    Gardens, Clovis Farmers Market, Art Hop, and Central California Big Band Society dances. They 
                    were recently featured in a music video for local jazz band, Scats on The Sly, and have 
                    performed at events for the Fresno Grizzlies, Fresno County Public Library, and Fresno 
                    Philharmonic.
                    <br><br>
                    The members of Fresno Swing Dance appear to be powered by positive energy. When asked if 
                    anyone ever gets cranky or in a bad mood, Chris says, “That’s like asking if you ever get cranky 
                    about eating chocolate cake. It might not be great chocolate cake, 
                    but…it’s…still…chocolate…cake!” From Pasadena to Santa Cruz to Fresno, “It’s been a long 
                    slow process of creating this community, but we’ve done it for the joy of dancing, and I think that 
                    shows through.” One thing’s for certain: it’s definitely got that swing!
