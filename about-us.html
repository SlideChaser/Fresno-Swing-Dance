Our group meets weekly for dance lessons and social dancing on Tuesday nights (7:00-9:30PM) at Cal Arts Academy (on Blackstone Ave., between Shaw and Gettysburg Avenues). We have three simultaneous dance classes, ranging from beginners to intermediate, followed by an open dance. We also dance anywhere and everywhere there might be some excuse to swing dance!
