					<h2>Take Your First Class</h2>
					<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to swing dance but didn't know where to start?? Well, you have come to the right place!
					We'll teach you the steps you need to know to have a good time.</p><br>
					<p>No partner? No problem. Our classes are social and rotate partners and you'll meet a ton of cool, new people. Do you have a partner and only want to dance with them? That's cool with us too. When the class rotates just stay with your partner.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We now offer a Lindy Hop class! This is a class that you need to be able to do the basic steps from 6ct swing. This a progressive series so, you do need to start it at the beginning of the month. If you miss the first week then you just have to wait for the next month to start. If you don't know how to rock-step or triple-step, you will be asked to take the 6ct swing lesson. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes early (7:15PM).</p>
					<br>
					<p>**Late Policy: We understand that unforeseen circumstances may cause tardiness; however, to ensure the smooth running of our dance classes and out of respect for our instructors and fellow dancers in our community. Dancers who arrive more than 15 mins late (7:45) will not be allowed to join the class. You may still join us for social dance! Put on your shoes, stretch, get water, and join us in the main room at 8:30. We look forward to dancing with you.**</p>
					<h3>Dress Code:</h3>
					<p>Wear what is comfortable for you! Some people dress up, some people dress vintage, and other people wear jeans and a T-shirt. We especially recommend comfortable shoes or dance shoes with a small heel or wedge (shoes that don't fall of your feet).</p>
					<p>Dress code is casual.</p>
					<p>Wear shoes that don't fall off your feet, and bring a water bottle!</p>

					<h2>COVID-19 SAFETY MEASURES</h2>
					<p>
						We welcome all those who want to attend regardless of their vaccination status.<br>
						However, we still strongly encourage everyone to mask up (preferably with N95's) while partner dancing.<br> Be kind and compassionate to people's choices.<br> We also remind people to continue practicing good hygiene; washing hands (hand sanitizer is provided), coughing into elbows, staying home when sick, etc. 
						<br>
						The pandemic is not over, but we can dance if we do it safely. So, let's dance!
					</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Parking</h2>

					</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Late Policy</h2>
					<p>We understand that unforeseen circumstances may cause tardiness; however, to ensure the smooth running of our dance classes and out of respect for our instructors and fellow dancers in our community, Fresno Swing Dance abides by the following late arrival policy:</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li><span>Arrival Time:</span> Please plan to arrive at least 15 minutes before the start of lessons. This allows time for check-in to be completed and ensures that lessons start at the scheduled time.</li>
						<li><span>Late Arrival Window:</span> If you arrive within the first 15 minutes after the class has started, you may still join the class. Please enter quietly so as not to disrupt ongoing activities.</li>
						<li><span>Late Arrivals After 15 Minutes:</span> Dancers who arrive more than 15 minutes late will not be allowed to join the class. This is both for the benefit of the latecomer, as joining a class mid-session can increase the risk of injury due to insufficient warm-up, and for the consideration of the instructor and other students who deserve an uninterrupted learning environment.</li>
						<li><span>Social Dance Only Option:</span> If you arrive late, you may still join us for social dance! Put on your shoes, stretch, get water, and join us in the main room at 8:30PM. We look forward to dancing with you.</li>
					</ul>
