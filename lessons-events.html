					<h3>Take Your First Class</h3>
					<p>Have you always wanted to learn how to swing dance but didn't know where to start?? Well, you have come to the right place!
					We'll teach you the steps you need to know to have a good time.</p><br>
					<p>No partner? No problem. Our classes are social and rotate partners and you'll meet a ton of cool, new people. Do you have a partner and only want to dance with them? That's cool with us too. When the class rotates just stay with your partner.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We now offer a Lindy Hop class! This is a class that you need to be able to do the basic steps from 6ct swing. This a progressive series so, you do need to start it at the beginning of the month. If you miss the first week then you just have to wait for the next month to start. If you don't know how to rock-step or triple-step, you will be asked to take the 6ct swing lesson. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes early (7:15PM).</p>
					<p>Dress code is casual.</p>
					<p>Wear shoes that don't fall off your feet, and bring a water bottle!</p>
